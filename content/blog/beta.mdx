We're very excited to officially release Contentlayer in beta after many months of alpha testing and already being used in over 300 projects.

## Motivation: Thinking of Content as Data

How we build content-driven web experiences [has evolved significantly](/blog/working-with-content-is-hard-for-developers) over the past three decades. From monolithic CMSs (like Wordpress) over template-based site generators (like Jekyll) to modern web frameworks (like Next.js).

While developers gained more flexibility in the way they can design and structure their site - it also came at the cost of having to take responsibility over how to process and serve the content.

 

Since most modern site frameworks (like Next.js, Remix etc) are "content agnostic", it's the responsibility of the developer to provide the **content as data** to the application in order to render it. This either means consuming the content data from an API (e.g. when using a headless CMS) or doing some form of manual **content pre-processing** which converts the raw content files (e.g. Markdown) into JSON data.

This content pre-processing step can be surprisingly difficult as the following example illustrates.

### DIY Example with Next.js + Markdown

Let's look at a concrete example without Contentlayer (see [source on GitHub](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer-benchmarks/tree/main/next-remark)). When building a website using Next.js with local Markdown files as your content source, youâ€™d have to develop a mechanism that converted those Markdown files into data that you could use in your Next.js pages.

 

That's already a lot code for a simple use case - and it's just the tip of the iceberg. To achieve a more reliable setup with a decent developer experience, youâ€™d have to also take care of the following:

 
Doing all of this is an insane amount of work - and you really shouldn't have to build this yourself.

## Introducing Contentlayer

And thatâ€™s why we built Contentlayer. **Contentlayer makes working with content easy** for developers.

 

### How Contentlayer Works

After installing Contentlayer via `npm install contentlayer next-contentlayer` you're ready to go:

1. First you need to tell Contentlayer where your content lives and which format and structure it has. There are different kinds of content sources - here we're using local Markdown files.

 

2. Run Contentlayer to transform the content into data. This can be done independently, or by hooking into framework server/build processes.

 

3. Use `import` to work with your content, just as you would with any other data or code in your application.

 

### Playground: Try it Yourself

To get a better feeling for how Contentlayer works and how to use it, it's best to actually use it. We've included a interactive playground with a real Next.js + Contentlayer project below. (Currently works best in Chrome on Desktop).

Go ahead - give it a try! For example, make a change to one of the Markdown files in the `posts` directory - you should see the page live-reload instantly.

<div className="my-24 xl:-mx-40">
 
</div>

- The content is generated into a `.contentlayer/generated` directory that includes JSON content caches, exported collections of data, and automatically-generated types.
- The `pages/posts/[[...slug]].tsx` page brings in the content directly, manipulates it as needed, and passes it onto the page component.

## Benefits of Contentlayer

Contentlayer aims to provide a great developer experience (DX) through the following features:

 

### Build Performance Comparison: Contentlayer vs DIY and Gatsby

We put our claims to the test and [built a simple benchmark study](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer-benchmarks) that compared a Next.js site with 1,000+ markdown content files to the same site using a DIY content processing method. We then built the same site with Gatsby.

<div className="my-8 space-y-4">
  
  <div className="flex w-full justify-center text-sm text-slate-300 dark:text-slate-500">
    Smaller is better/faster. Used machine: [GitHub
    Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources)
  </div>
</div>

In both cases, using Contentlayer was nearly **twice as fast**. Even when we tested against warm builds, where the frameworks could make use of cached artifacts from previous builds, Contentlayer was still nearly twice as fast. (Note these numbers might differ on machines with more CPUs as Contentlayer doesn't yet support [parallel content processing](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/60).)

## The Future of Content(layer)

This beta release of Contentlayer marks an important milestone in the [roadmap of the project](/docs/other/roadmap) - but we're just getting started. Over the coming months leading up to a stable 1.0 release we're aiming to accomplish the following:

- Add support for more content sources (e.g. [Contentful](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/173), [Notion](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/174), ...) and even supporting [multiple content sources](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/84) in a single project
- Providing seamless integrations for more site frameworks (such as [Vite](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/179), [Remix](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/169), [Astro](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/171), ...)
- Validate and evolve the core abstractions of Contentlayer to avoid breaking changes after the 1.0 release
